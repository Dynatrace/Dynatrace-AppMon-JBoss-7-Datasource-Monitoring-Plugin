Starting "Jboss 7" or "Jboss EAP 6", Jboss has stopped the support for exposing connection pool statistics via JMX beans. If you want to use the dynaTrace JMX based measure to monitor your datasource
usage/statistics you wont be able to do so.This plugin will help you capture the datasource statistics in "Jboss 7" or "Jboss EAP 6" using the new REST based Jboss management console. Once you capture
the measure you can chart on the data.

Here is a screen shot of a dashboard, which monitors the active Connection on individual data-sources.
